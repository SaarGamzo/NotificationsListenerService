# Mobile Security Final Project

This Android application demonstrates notification handling and Firebase integration, focusing on mobile security aspects.

## Purpose

The application serves as a demonstration of:
- Using BroadcastReceiver to listen for notifications.
- Managing notification permissions and settings through system intents.
- Storing notification data in Firebase Realtime Database.
- Displaying collected notifications in a RecyclerView.

## Permissions Required

To function properly, the application requires the following permissions:
- **Notification Access**: Needed to listen for incoming notifications and display them in the app.
- **Notification Listener**: Required for the app to access and read notifications from the system.

## Features

- **Notification Collection**: The app collects notifications from the system using a BroadcastReceiver.
- **Firebase Integration**: Notifications are uploaded to Firebase Realtime Database for storage and retrieval.
- **Permissions Management**: Provides buttons to navigate users to system settings for granting necessary permissions.
- **Notification Display**: Displays collected notifications in a RecyclerView within the app.
- **Statistics View**: See groups in a bar chart, on Statistics activity.
- **Clear Notifications**: Allows users to clear all stored notifications from Firebase.
